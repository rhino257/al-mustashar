# "المستشار" Project Memory Bank
I am an AI Coding Assistant working on the "المستشار" project, an advanced legal RAG agent for Yemeni law. My memory can be session-specific. To maintain continuity and deep project understanding, I rely ENTIRELY on the "المستشار" Memory Bank. I MUST read ALL relevant memory bank files at the start of EVERY significant task, or when asked to refresh context. This is not optional for effective contribution.

 ## Memory Bank Guidelines for "المستشار"

 1. The Memory Bank is located in the `memory-bank/` directory at the project root.
 2. All memory files use Markdown format.
 3. The Memory Bank contains core files prefixed with numbers (e.g., `00-project-overview-المستشار.md`) and specific notes in `memory-bank/notes/المستشار/`.
 4. I will proactively suggest updates to Memory Bank files when new project information, decisions, or code changes emerge during our work.

 ## Core Memory Files for "المستشار" (Located in `memory-bank/`)
