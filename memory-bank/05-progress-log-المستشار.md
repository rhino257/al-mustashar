 ## II. Work Completed Since Last Handoff (May 27-28, 2025)

 ### Task 13: Plan and Implement: Adapt `UnderstandQueryStep` to LangGraph for "المستشار" (Completed May 27)
 - **Status:** Completed.
 - **Summary of Implementation:** (Details as previously logged)
   - Created `understand_yemeni_legal_query_node` and `YemeniLegalQueryAnalysis` model.
   - Updated `AgentState` and `generate_query_embedding_node`.
   - Integrated into graph with new routing logic.

 ### Tasks 14 & 15: Implement Core Response Generation and Basic Test Harness (Completed May 27)
 - **Status:** Completed.
 - **Summary of Implementation:** (Details as previously logged)
   - Added response fields to `AgentState`.
   - Implemented `SynthesizeYemeniLegalAnswerNode` and `HandleConversationalQueryNode` with prompts.
   - Created initial `tests/integration_tests/test_almustashar_agent.py`.

 ### Task: Troubleshoot OpenAI API Key (Completed May 27)
 - **Status:** Completed.
 - **Summary:** (Details as previously logged)
    - Resolved 401 errors and Pinecone configuration issues by using `dotenv_values()`.

 ### Task: Resolve `final_state` Unwrapping Issue in Test Script (May 27-28, 2025 - Iterative Fix)
 - **Status:** Completed (Third Attempt).
 - **Summary:**
    - Addressed a persistent warning in `tests/integration_tests/test_almustashar_agent.py`: `WARNING:__main__:Final state (after unwrapping) is not a dict or AgentState instance. Type: <class 'list'>`.
    - **Third attempt** (May 28), guided by DeepSearch LLM, involved using `stream_mode="values"` for `astream_events` and simplifying state extraction logic.
    - This approach successfully changed `final_state` to a dictionary-like object (`langgraph.pregel.io.AddableValuesDict`), resolving the list-type warning.

 ### Task: Fix `AttributeError` for `YemeniLegalQueryAnalysis` fields in Test Script (May 28, 2025)
 - **Status:** Completed.
 - **Summary:**
    - Fixed `AttributeError`s in `tests/integration_tests/test_almustashar_agent.py` related to accessing fields on the `YemeniLegalQueryAnalysis` object (e.g., `query_type_classification`, `identified_law_name`) by correcting them to use the actual field names defined in the Pydantic model (e.g., `classification`, `law_name`).

 ### Task: Implement Supabase Direct Lookup Feature (May 28, 2025)
 - **Status:** Implemented and partially tested.
 - **Summary:**
    - Switched to using the official Supabase MCP server (`github.com/supabase-community/supabase-mcp`) after user setup, configured with `--read-only` mode.
    - Used its `list_tables` tool to confirm `law_articles` and `law` table schemas.
    - Created `src/custom_nodes/direct_lookup_node.py` with `prepare_direct_lookup_node` and `process_direct_lookup_result_node`.
        - `prepare_direct_lookup_node` creates SQL query and MCP call args. It was refined to adjust the search term for "قانون العمل اليمني" to "قانون العمل" to match database storage, based on user feedback.
        - `process_direct_lookup_result_node` processes MCP response into Documents.
    - Updated `AgentState` with `direct_lookup_mcp_args` and `direct_lookup_mcp_response`.
    - Updated `src/retrieval_graph/graph.py` with an `initial_intake_router` and new routing for the direct lookup path.
    - Updated `src/custom_nodes/__init__.py`.
    - Successfully tested the query preparation and MCP `execute_sql` call for a direct lookup query ("ما هي المادة 5 من قانون العمل اليمني؟"), which returned the correct article.

 ### Task: Fix LangGraph `InvalidUpdateError` for `initial_intake_router` (May 28, 2025)
 - **Status:** Completed.
 - **Summary:**
    - Resolved `langgraph.errors.InvalidUpdateError: Expected dict, got understand_yemeni_legal_query_node` which occurred during the `initial_intake_router` task.
    - The error was due to incorrectly adding the `initial_intake_router` function as a standard node.
    - Corrected `src/retrieval_graph/graph.py` by removing the `builder.add_node("initial_intake_router", ...)` and related incorrect `add_conditional_edges` call, and instead used `builder.set_conditional_entry_point(initial_intake_router, ...)` to properly define it as a conditional entry router.

 ## III. Work Completed on May 30, 2025

 ### Task: Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) Streaming Logic
 - **Status:** Completed.
 - **Summary:**
    - Modified the `_rag_response_stream` function in `src/almustashar_api/routers/rag_almustashar_router.py`.
    - Adapted the streaming logic to correctly process events from `almustashar_agent.astream_events(...)` based on detailed specifications provided by the user, referencing an old system's `process_rag_stream` function.
    - Key changes include:
        - Standardized variable names for SSE message IDs (`client_ai_message_id`, `internal_ai_message_id`).
        - Ensured correct emission of `metadata` and `stream_initiated` SSE events.
        - Implemented logic to identify and process LLM stream chunks (`on_chat_model_stream` from `synthesize_yemeni_legal_answer_node` or `handle_conversational_query_node`) for `message_update` events, accumulating the full response in `full_answer`.
        - Refined the capture of source documents for the `message_finalized` event, prioritizing `final_documents_for_synthesis` from the graph's final state and ensuring correct formatting.
        - Ensured the `message_finalized` event (for both success and error cases) adheres to the specified structure, including all required fields and IDs.
        - Incorporated debug print statements as requested.
        - Added `import traceback` and `from langchain_core.documents import Document as LangchainDocument`.
    - The implementation aims to produce the same SSE event structure as the old system.

 ## IV. Work Completed on May 31, 2025

 ### Task: Resolve API Runtime Errors (JSONDecodeError and TypeError)
 - **Status:** Completed.
 - **Summary:**
    - **Fixed `JSONDecodeError` in `src/custom_nodes/comprehension_nodes.py`**:
        - Modified `understand_yemeni_legal_query_node` to handle cases where the LLM returns empty content after cleaning. If empty, it now defaults to a `YemeniLegalQueryAnalysis` object with `classification="other"`, preventing `json.loads()` from failing on an empty string.
    - **Fixed `TypeError` in `src/almustashar_api/routers/rag_almustashar_router.py`**:
        - In the `query_rag_agent_get` endpoint, an instance of `RagQueryRequest` is now constructed using the individual GET query parameters.
        - The call to `_rag_response_stream` within `query_rag_agent_get` was updated to correctly pass the `request` object and the newly constructed `RagQueryRequest` instance, satisfying the function's signature.
    - Updated `memory-bank/resolved_issues_log.md` with details of these fixes.

 ## V. Current State & Next Immediate Task (as of May 31, 2025)
 - The API runtime errors (`JSONDecodeError` and `TypeError`) observed in the Uvicorn logs have been addressed.
 - The SSE streaming logic in `_rag_response_stream` was previously updated.
 - Test script `tests/integration_tests/test_almustashar_agent.py` is running without Python errors for existing conversational and conceptual search queries, and correctly logs HyDE information.
 - The Supabase Direct Lookup feature has been implemented.
 - The Memory Bank (`resolved_issues_log.md` and this `progress_log.md`) has been updated.

 ### Task 0: Fix Document Propagation from Pinecone Retriever to Synthesis Node (May 31, 2025)
 - **Status:** Completed.
 - **Summary:**
    - **Problem:** Documents retrieved by `pinecone_semantic_retriever_node` were not reaching `synthesize_yemeni_legal_answer_node` when reranking was disabled. The retriever updated `state.documents`, but `prepare_synthesis_node` (when not reranking) read from `state.retrieved_documents`.
    - **Fix:** Modified `pinecone_semantic_retriever_node` in `src/custom_nodes/retrieval_nodes.py` to return `{"retrieved_documents": ...}` instead of `{"documents": ...}`. This aligns its output with the field expected by `prepare_synthesis_node`.
    - This ensures that retrieved documents are correctly passed to the synthesis stage.

 ### Task: Fix Document Propagation from Supabase Direct Lookup to Synthesis Node (May 31, 2025)
 - **Status:** Completed.
 - **Summary:**
    - **Problem:** Documents retrieved by `process_direct_lookup_result_node` (Supabase direct lookup) were not being passed to `synthesize_yemeni_legal_answer_node`. The `process_direct_lookup_result_node` populated `state.documents`, but the graph routed directly to synthesis, bypassing `prepare_synthesis_node` which populates `state.final_documents_for_synthesis` (the field expected by the synthesis node).
    - **Fix 1:** Modified `process_direct_lookup_result_node` in `src/custom_nodes/direct_lookup_node.py` to return `{"retrieved_documents": ...}` instead of `{"documents": ...}`.
    - **Fix 2:** Modified `src/retrieval_graph/graph.py` to change the edge from `process_direct_lookup_result_node` to route to `prepare_synthesis_node` instead of directly to `synthesize_yemeni_legal_answer_node`.
    - This ensures documents from direct Supabase lookup flow through `prepare_synthesis_node` and are correctly placed in `state.final_documents_for_synthesis` for the synthesis node.

 ### Task: Implement Hybrid Search for Comments Table (May 31, 2025)
 - **Status:** Completed.
 - **Summary:**
    - **Goal:** Extend hybrid search to include the `comments` table alongside `law_articles`.
    - **Approach:** Created a new RPC function for comments and modified Python code to call both RPCs concurrently and merge results.
    - **Step 1 (User Action):** User created a new Supabase RPC function `public.hybrid_search_comments_rrf` designed to perform hybrid search (semantic + keyword with RRF) on the `public.comments` table. This function uses the `embedding` column for semantic search and `COALESCE(processed_text, content)` for keyword search.
    - **Step 2 (Code Change):** Modified `src/custom_nodes/law_articles_adapter.py`:
        - Renamed existing `hybrid_search` to `hybrid_search_articles`.
        - Added a new method `hybrid_search_comments` to call the `hybrid_search_comments_rrf` RPC.
        - Updated `map_db_result_to_document` to handle `item_type` ('article' or 'comment') and map fields accordingly, storing `item_type` in metadata.
    - **Step 3 (Code Change):** Modified `supabase_hybrid_retriever_node` in `src/custom_nodes/retrieval_nodes.py`:
        - Imported `asyncio`.
        - Updated to call `adapter.hybrid_search_articles` and `adapter.hybrid_search_comments` concurrently using `asyncio.gather`.
        - Combined the lists of article and comment documents.
        - Sorted the combined list by the `score` (rrf_score from RPCs) in descending order.
        - Applied the final `hybrid_search_match_count` limit to the merged list.
        - Updated logging to reflect the merged results and item types.
    - This enables the RAG pipeline to retrieve and rank relevant information from both law articles and comments concurrently.
 ### Task: Update Document Limit for Synthesis (May 31, 2025)
 - **Status:** Completed.
 - **Summary:**
    - Modified `src/shared/configuration.py` to change the default value of `hybrid_search_match_count` from 10 to 20.
    - This increases the number of documents (combined from articles and comments) that are passed to the synthesis stage, allowing for testing with a larger context.

 ### Task: Fix Reranker Node AttributeError (May 31, 2025)
 - **Status:** Completed.
 - **Summary:**
    - **Problem:** The `reranker_node` in `src/custom_nodes/retrieval_nodes.py` was causing an `AttributeError: 'AgentConfiguration' object has no attribute 'reranker_model_name'` (and subsequently would have failed for `reranker_top_k`).
    - **Diagnosis:** The `AgentConfiguration` class in `src/retrieval_graph/configuration.py` was missing the `reranker_model_name` and `reranker_top_k` attributes.
    - **Fix:** Modified `src/retrieval_graph/configuration.py` to add the `reranker_model_name: Optional[str]` and `reranker_top_k: int` fields to the `AgentConfiguration` dataclass, with appropriate defaults and metadata.
    - This resolves the `AttributeError` and allows the reranker node to correctly access its configuration.

 ### Task: Enhance HyDE Generation for Complex Queries (June 1, 2025)
 - **Status:** Completed.
 - **Summary:**
    - **Goal:** Improve the relevance of semantically retrieved documents by making the Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE) more specific and detailed, especially for complex legal questions.
    - **Change:** Modified the system prompt within the `understand_yemeni_legal_query_node` in `src/custom_nodes/comprehension_nodes.py`.
    - **Details of Prompt Change:**
        - Added a new point to the "Consider the following when crafting this `hypothetical_answer_for_embedding`" section: "**Specificity for Complex Queries**: For queries seeking specific details (e.g., 'what is the penalty for X?', 'how many witnesses for Y?', 'what are the conditions for Z?'), the hypothetical answer should *include plausible, concrete examples* of those details. For instance, if asked for a number, provide a specific number; if asked for conditions, list specific-sounding conditions. This specificity is crucial for effective embedding and retrieval, even if the LLM has to generate a plausible detail for the sake of the HyDE."
        - Updated the "Instruction for `hypothetical_answer_for_embedding` field" to be more directive: "Based on the user's `raw_query` and `chat_history`, craft an ideal, information-rich, and **highly specific** paragraph in ARABIC that represents the most relevant and comprehensive document snippet an expert would expect to find to **definitively answer** this Yemeni legal question. This snippet should sound like it's directly from an authoritative legal text that *does* answer the question and will be used to find similar actual documents. **For complex queries asking for specific details (e.g., numbers, conditions, criteria), the hypothetical answer should *contain* plausible specific details as if found in a perfect document.**"
    - This aims to guide the LLM in the comprehension node to generate HyDE answers that are better queries for the vector database, leading to more relevant document retrieval.

 - **Next immediate task:** Testing and verification of the impact of enhanced HyDE generation on retrieval quality, alongside ongoing testing of hybrid search and reranker functionality.

 ### Task: Optimize Response Time for Simple Greetings (June 6, 2025)
 - **Status:** Completed.
 - **Summary:**
    - **Goal:** Reduce the perceived latency for common conversational greetings.
    - **Problem Analysis:** Identified that simple greetings like "السلام عليكم" took ~4.7 seconds before streaming due to two sequential LLM calls: one in `understand_yemeni_legal_query_node` (~3s) for analysis, and one in `handle_conversational_query_node` (~1.7s) for response generation. The latter node was also making two internal LLM calls.
    - **Fix 1 (Response Node Optimization):** Modified `synthesize_yemeni_legal_answer_node` and `handle_conversational_query_node` in `src/custom_nodes/response_nodes.py` to make only a single LLM call each. The full response text is now intended to be accumulated by the router from the `llm_output_stream` for saving purposes, while the node itself just provides the stream. This change aims to halve the execution time of these nodes if the LLM call was the primary bottleneck.
    - **Fix 2 (Greeting Bypass):** Modified `initial_intake_router` in `src/retrieval_graph/graph.py` to detect a predefined list of simple Arabic greetings. If a greeting is matched, the router now directs the flow straight to `handle_conversational_query_node`, bypassing the `understand_yemeni_legal_query_node` entirely for these cases. The conditional entry point mapping in the graph builder was updated accordingly.
    - **Expected Impact:** Significant reduction in response time for common greetings.
    - **Next Steps:** Test the impact of these changes on response latency and overall system behavior.

 ### Task: Further Optimize Conversational Query Latency (June 6, 2025)
 - **Status:** Completed (Phase 1).
 - **Summary:**
    - **Goal:** Reduce latency for general conversational queries (e.g., "من انت؟") that are not simple greetings, aiming for sub-second responses from the `understand_yemeni_legal_query_node`.
    - **Approach (Phase 1):**
        - **Enhanced `_quick_query_analysis`:** Modified this heuristic function in `src/custom_nodes/comprehension_nodes.py` to better identify "purely_conversational_heuristic" queries by checking for common Arabic conversational phrases/patterns and the *absence* of predefined legal keywords.
        - **Conditional LLM Task Simplification:** Implemented logic in `understand_yemeni_legal_query_node` (in `src/custom_nodes/comprehension_nodes.py`):
            - If a query is flagged as `"purely_conversational_heuristic"`:
                - A new Pydantic model `SimpleClassificationTool` (with only a `classification` field) is used.
                - A simplified system prompt instructs the LLM to *only* perform classification using this simpler tool.
            - Otherwise (for potentially legal or mixed queries):
                - The existing, comprehensive `YemeniLegalQueryAnalysis` tool is used for full analysis (HyDE, entity extraction, etc.).
        - **Pydantic Model:** Added `SimpleClassificationTool` to `src/custom_nodes/comprehension_nodes.py`.
    - **Expected Impact:** Faster processing within `understand_yemeni_legal_query_node` for queries correctly identified as purely conversational, as the LLM's task is significantly simpler. Full analysis capabilities are preserved for all other queries.
    - **Next Steps (User):** Thoroughly test with diverse queries (purely conversational, purely legal, and especially mixed queries) to validate the accuracy of the heuristic and the overall performance. Refine heuristics in `_quick_query_analysis` if needed based on testing.
